This is to be a little hexmap you can draw scenarios on for table top gaming.

Goals:
 * It should be simple to use-- even during gameplay. Don't get bogged 
   down making extremely detailed visually appealing maps. Make something
   that shares the info and move on.
 * Have a key for  <color> : <what it represents>.
   Be able to add new color/definitions to there. Click on an existing one 
   to start drawing with it. Delete an existing one and any drawing in that color.
 * Use layered drawing.
 * It should be multiuser editable. Several people can add/edit simultaneously.
   Probably pull in couchdb or something similar as the datastore there.
 * Saving/Loading
 * Hyperlinkable to load a map -- this is also useful for doors or teleport.
